# Key Recommendations and Way Forward

**Recommendations are tailored for different stakeholders within Foresight Pharmaceuticals:**

For the C-Suite:

**Strategic Market Expansion**:  Germany has an overwhelming contribution (94% of total sales), exploring strategies to replicate this success in other markets or deeply analyzing the German market's unique drivers for sustained growth will be key to stragetic expansion. Consideration targeted investments will boost performance in Poland.

**Product Portfolio Optimization**: investing in and promoting top-performing products like Ionclotide and  product class like Analgesics. Conducting further analysis into the factors contributing to their success, and applying the results to boost performance of poorly performing products.

**Return Rate Reduction Initiative**: Establishing a cross-functional task force to investigate the root causes of product returns, especially for Dantolac Pazocor and Ketamara Evogel, and the Analgesics and Antipyretics product classes will help in identifying the cause of product returns and its resolution. This initiative should aim to identify issues in product quality, packaging, logistics, or customer education, product batch and product side effects.

**Sales Channel Strategy Review**: Capitalize on the strong performance of the Pharmacy channel, especially the "Retail" sub-channel. Allocate resources to further optimize this channel and understand why it outperforms the Hospital channel.

For the Sales Managers:

**Replicate Success of Top Performers**: Further analysis of the strategies and best practices of the Delta sales team to identify actionable insights that can be shared across all sales teams. Implement training programs based on their success.

**Performance Management for Returns**: Work directly with Thompson Crawford and other sales representatives to understand the reasons behind the high volume of returned products under their sales. Provide targeted training, support, or re-assignment if necessary.

**Product-Specific Sales Training**: Development of specialized training modules for products like Dantolac Pazocor and Ketamara Evogel, focusing on addressing common customer issues or misunderstandings that led to returns.

**Customer Relationship Management**: Collaboration with sales representative to understand the specific issues leading to returns from customers like Welch-Orn Pharm, Dach PLC and others. Development of tailored strategies to improve customer satisfaction and reduce returns from these accounts.

For the Sales Representatives:

**Focus on High-Value Products and Classes**: Prioritization of efforts on selling Ionclotide and products within the Analgesics product class. Understand their unique selling propositions and target audience.

**Customer Education**: When selling products that have a high return rate (e.g., Dantolac Pazocor, Ketamara Evogel, and products from Analgesics and Antipyretics classes), ensure customers are thoroughly educated on proper usage, storage, and any potential side effects to minimize returns.

**Feedback Loop on Returns**: Provision of detailed feedback to management regarding the reasons for product returns. This information will be crucial to identifying systemic issues and improving product quality or customer support.

**Leverage Channel Strengths**: Focus efforts on the Pharmacy channel, particularly the Retail sub-channel, as these have demonstrated higher performance metrics.

For the Distributors:

**Quality Control at Distribution Points**: Implement stricter quality checks before products leave the distribution center to identify any damaged or expired products that might lead to returns.

**Communication Protocol**: Establish a clear communication protocol with Foresight Pharmaceuticals for reporting and handling returned products to expedite the process and gather critical data on return reasons.
